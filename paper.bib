              Machine learning: the power and promise of computers that learn by example
              . Report no. DES4702. Issued April 2017. Royal Society). A small fraction of these data is collected with the aim of validating specific hypotheses. These studies are led by the development of mechanistic models focused on the causality of input–output relationships. However, the vast majority is aimed at supporting statistical or correlation studies that bypass the need for causality and focus exclusively on prediction. Along these lines, there has been a vast increase in the use of machine learning models, in particular in the biomedical and clinical sciences, to try and keep pace with the rate of data generation. Recent successes now beg the question of whether mechanistic models are still relevant in this area. Said otherwise, why should we try to understand the mechanisms of disease progression when we can use machine learning tools to directly predict disease outcome?},

We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (
              i
              ) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (
              ii
              ) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on
              in vitro
              labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (
              iii
              ) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded
              in vitro
              in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales.},

It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Dr Judea Pearl has received the 2011 Rumelhart Prize for his leading research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and systems from The Cognitive Science Society.},

    abstract = {The paper introduces a novel conditional independence (CI) based method for linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous causal discovery from observational time series in the causally sufﬁcient case. Existing CI-based methods such as the PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks suffer from low recall and partially inﬂated false positives for strong autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous challenge in time series. The novel method, PCMCI+, extends PCMCI [Runge et al., 2019b] to include discovery of contemporaneous links. PCMCI+ improves the reliability of CI tests by optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even beneﬁts from autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle case. A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI+ has higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false positives. Optimized conditioning sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than the PC algorithm. PCMCI+ can be of considerable use in many real world application scenarios where often time resolutions are too coarse to resolve time delays and strong autocorrelation is present.},

Here we introduce a large assembled library of 237 statistics of pairwise interactions, and assess their behavior on 1,053 multivariate time series from a wide range of real-world and model-generated systems. Our analysis highlights commonalities between disparate mathematical formulations of interactions, providing a unified picture of a rich interdisciplinary literature. Using three real-world case studies, we then show that simultaneously leveraging diverse methods can uncover those most suitable for addressing a given problem, facilitating interpretable understanding of the quantitative formulation of pairwise dependencies that drive successful performance. Our results and accompanying software enable comprehensive analysis of time-series interactions by drawing on decades of diverse methodological contributions.},

	abstract = {A network consists of two interdependent parts: the network topology or graph, consisting of the links between nodes and the network dynamics, specified by some governing equations. A crucial challenge is the prediction of dynamics on networks, such as forecasting the spread of an infectious disease on a human contact network. Unfortunately, an accurate prediction of the dynamics seems hardly feasible, because the network is often complicated and unknown. In this work, given past observations of the dynamics on a fixed graph, we show the contrary: Even without knowing the network topology, we can predict the dynamics. Specifically, for a general class of deterministic governing equations, we propose a two-step prediction algorithm. First, we obtain a surrogate network by fitting past observations of every nodal state to the dynamical model. Second, we iterate the governing equations on the surrogate network to predict the dynamics. Surprisingly, even though there is no similarity between the surrogate topology and the true topology, the predictions are accurate, for a considerable prediction time horizon, for a broad range of observation times, and in the presence of a reasonable noise level. The true topology is not needed for predicting dynamics on networks, since the dynamics evolve in a subspace of astonishingly low dimension compared to the size and heterogeneity of the graph. Our results constitute a fresh perspective on the broad field of nonlinear dynamics on complex networks.},
